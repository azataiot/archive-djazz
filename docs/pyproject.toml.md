# `pyproject.toml` file

[`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) is a configuration file that becoming more and more popular in the Python ecosystem. It is used to
specify the build system, dependencies, and other configuration options for a Python project.

Djazz uses `pyproject.toml` to specify the djazz's dependencies, build system, and other configuration options, which
then can be consumed by tools like [Flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html) (djazz's build system), pip (
Python's package manager), and other tools or platforms like [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-djazz/) (Python
Package Index).
