ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,[::1],djazz.cc
POSTGRES_DB=djazz
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_HOST=db

# Email settings (mailpit)

```

The easiest way to run djazz is using Docker. Make sure you have **Docker installed on your machine**.

```bash
docker compose --profile debug up
```

or you can use the `djazz CLI` tool [Coming soon! ðŸš§](#) :

development server at `http://localhost:8000/`.
